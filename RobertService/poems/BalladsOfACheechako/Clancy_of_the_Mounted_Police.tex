\poemchapter{Clancy of the Mounted Police}

\begin{poemblock}
 In the little Crimson Manual it's written plain and clear\\
 That who would wear the scarlet coat shall say good-bye to fear;\\
 Shall be a guardian of the right, a sleuth-hound of the trail--\\
 In the little Crimson Manual there's no such word as "fail"--\\
 Shall follow on though heavens fall, or hell's top-turrets freeze,\\
 Half round the world, if need there be, on bleeding hands and knees.\\
 It's duty, duty, first and last, the Crimson Manual saith;\\
 The Scarlet Rider makes reply: "It's duty--to the death."\\
 And so they sweep the solitudes, free men from all the earth;\\
 And so they sentinel the woods, the wilds that know their worth;\\
 And so they scour the startled plains and mock at hurt and pain,\\
 And read their Crimson Manual, and find their duty plain.\\
 Knights of the lists of unrenown, born of the frontier's need,\\
 Disdainful of the spoken word, exultant in the deed;\\
 Unconscious heroes of the waste, proud players of the game,\\
 Props of the power behind the throne, upholders of the name:\\
 For thus the Great White Chief hath said, "In all my lands be peace",\\
 And to maintain his word he gave his West the Scarlet Police.

 Livid-lipped was the valley, still as the grave of God;\\
\idt Misty shadows of mountain thinned into mists of cloud;\\
 Corpselike and stark was the land, with a quiet that crushed and awed,\\
\idt And the stars of the weird sub-arctic glimmered over its shroud.

 Deep in the trench of the valley two men stationed the Post,\\
\idt Seymour and Clancy the reckless, fresh from the long patrol;\\
 Seymour, the sergeant, and Clancy--Clancy who made his boast\\
\idt He could cinch like a bronco the Northland,\\
and cling to the prongs of the Pole.

 Two lone men on detachment, standing for law on the trail;\\
\idt Undismayed in the vastness, wise with the wisdom of old--\\
 Out of the night hailed a half-breed telling a pitiful tale,\\
\idt "White man starving and crazy on the banks of the Nordenscold."

 Up sprang the red-haired Clancy, lean and eager of eye;\\
\idt Loaded the long toboggan, strapped each dog at its post;\\
 Whirled his lash at the leader; then, with a whoop and a cry,\\
\idt Into the Great White Silence faded away like a ghost.

 The clouds were a misty shadow, the hills were a shadowy mist;\\
\idt Sunless, voiceless and pulseless, the day was a dream of woe;\\
 Through the ice-rifts the river smoked and bubbled and hissed;\\
\idt Behind was a trail fresh broken, in front the untrodden snow.

 Ahead of the dogs ploughed Clancy, haloed by steaming breath;\\
\idt Through peril of open water, through ache of insensate cold;\\
 Up rivers wantonly winding in a land affianced to death,\\
\idt Till he came to a cowering cabin on the banks of the Nordenscold.

 Then Clancy loosed his revolver, and he strode through the open door;\\
\idt And there was the man he sought for, crouching beside the fire;\\
 The hair of his beard was singeing, the frost on his back was hoar,\\
\idt And ever he crooned and chanted as if he never would tire:--
\textit{
\idt "I panned and I panned in the shiny sand,\\
and I sniped on the river bar;\\
\idt But I know, I know, that it's down below\\
that the golden treasures are;\\
\idt So I'll wait and wait till the floods abate,\\
and I'll sink a shaft once more,\\
\idt And I'd like to bet that I'll go home yet\\
with a brass band playing before."
}

 He was nigh as thin as a sliver, and he whined like a Moose-hide cur;\\
\idt So Clancy clothed him and nursed him as a mother nurses a child;\\
 Lifted him on the toboggan, wrapped him in robes of fur,\\
\idt Then with the dogs sore straining started to face the Wild.

 Said the Wild, "I will crush this Clancy, so fearless and insolent;\\
\idt For him will I loose my fury, and blind and buffet and beat;\\
 Pile up my snows to stay him; then when his strength is spent,\\
\idt Leap on him from my ambush and crush him under my feet.

 "Him will I ring with my silence, compass him with my cold;\\
\idt Closer and closer clutch him unto mine icy breast;\\
 Buffet him with my blizzards, deep in my snows enfold,\\
\idt Claiming his life as my tribute, giving my wolves the rest."

 Clancy crawled through the vastness; o'er him the hate of the Wild;\\
\idt Full on his face fell the blizzard; cheering his huskies he ran;\\
 Fighting, fierce-hearted and tireless, snows that drifted and piled,\\
\idt With ever and ever behind him singing the crazy man.

\indentedblock\itshape{
"Sing hey, sing ho, for the ice and snow,\\
\idt And a heart that's ever merry;\\
Let us trim and square with a lover's care\\
\idt (For why should a man be sorry?)\\
A grave deep, deep, with the moon a-peep,\\
\idt A grave in the frozen mould.\\
Sing hey, sing ho, for the winds that blow,\\
\idt And a grave deep down in the ice and snow,\\
A grave in the land of gold."
}

 Day after day of darkness, the whirl of the seething snows;\\
\idt Day after day of blindness, the swoop of the stinging blast;\\
 On through a blur of fury the swing of staggering blows;\\
\idt On through a world of turmoil, empty, inane and vast.

 Night with its writhing storm-whirl, night despairingly black;\\
\idt Night with its hours of terror, numb and endlessly long;\\
 Night with its weary waiting, fighting the shadows back,\\
\idt And ever the crouching madman singing his crazy song.

 Cold with its creeping terror, cold with its sudden clinch;\\
\idt Cold so utter you wonder if 'twill ever again be warm;\\
 Clancy grinned as he shuddered, "Surely it isn't a cinch\\
\idt Being wet-nurse to a looney in the teeth of an arctic storm."

 The blizzard passed and the dawn broke, knife-edged and crystal clear;\\
\idt The sky was a blue-domed iceberg, sunshine outlawed away;\\
 Ever by snowslide and ice-rip haunted and hovered the Fear;\\
\idt Ever the Wild malignant poised and panted to slay.

 The lead-dog freezes in harness--cut him out of the team!\\
\idt The lung of the wheel-dog's bleeding--shoot him and let him lie!\\
 On and on with the others--lash them until they scream!\\
\idt "Pull for your lives, you devils! On! To halt is to die."

 There in the frozen vastness Clancy fought with his foes;\\
\idt The ache of the stiffened fingers, the cut of the snowshoe thong;\\
 Cheeks black-raw through the hood-flap, eyes that tingled and closed,\\
\idt And ever to urge and cheer him quavered the madman's song.

 Colder it grew and colder, till the last heat left the earth,\\
\idt And there in the great stark stillness the bale fires glinted and gleamed,\\
 And the Wild all around exulted and shook with a devilish mirth,\\
\idt And life was far and forgotten, the ghost of a joy once dreamed.

Death! And one who defied it, a man of the Mounted Police;\\
\idt Fought it there to a standstill long after hope was gone;\\
 Grinned through his bitter anguish, fought without let or cease,\\
\idt Suffering, straining, striving, stumbling, struggling on.

Till the dogs lay down in their traces, and rose and staggered and fell;\\
\idt Till the eyes of him dimmed with shadows,\\
and the trail was so hard to see;\\
Till the Wild howled out triumphant, and the world was a frozen hell--\\
\idt Then said Constable Clancy:\idt "I guess that it's up to me."

 Far down the trail they saw him,\\
\idt and his hands they were blanched like bone;\\
\idt His face was a blackened horror, from his eyelids the salt rheum ran;\\
 His feet he was lifting strangely, as if they were made of stone,\\
\idt But safe in his arms and sleeping he carried the crazy man.\\

 So Clancy got into Barracks, and the boys made rather a scene;\\
\idt And the O. C. called him a hero, and was nice as a man could be;\\
 But Clancy gazed down his trousers at the place where his toes had been,\\
\idt And then he howled like a husky, and sang in a shaky key:

\textit{
"When I go back to the old love that's true to the finger-tips,\\
\idt I'll say:\idt `Here's bushels of gold, love,'\\
and I'll kiss my girl on the lips;\\
\idt `It's yours to have and to hold, love.'\\
It's the proud, proud boy I'll be,\\
\idt When I go back to the old love that's waited so long for me."
}
