\poemchapter{Men of the High North}

\begin{poemblock}
Men of the High North, the wild sky is blazing;\\
\idt Islands of opal float on silver seas;\\
Swift splendors kindle, barbaric, amazing;\\
\idt Pale ports of amber, golden argosies.\\
Ringed all around us the proud peaks are glowing;\\
\idt Fierce chiefs in council, their wigwam the sky;\\
Far, far below us the big Yukon flowing,\\
\idt Like threaded quicksilver, gleams to the eye.

Men of the High North, you who have known it;\\
\idt You in whose hearts its splendors have abode;\\
Can you renounce it, can you disown it?\\
\idt Can you forget it, its glory and its goad?\\
Where is the hardship, where is the pain of it?\\
\idt Lost in the limbo of things you've forgot;\\
Only remain the guerdon and gain of it;\\
\idt Zest of the foray, and God, how you fought!\\

You who have made good, you foreign faring;\\
\idt You money magic to far lands has whirled;\\
Can you forget those days of vast daring,\\
\idt There with your soul on the Top o' the World?\\
Nights when no peril could keep you awake on\\
\idt Spruce boughs you spread for your couch in the snow;\\
Taste all your feasts like the beans and the bacon\\
\idt Fried at the camp-fire at forty below?

Can you remember your huskies all going,\\
\idt Barking with joy and their brushes in air;\\
You in your parka, glad-eyed and glowing,\\
\idt Monarch, your subjects the wolf and the bear?\\
Monarch, your kingdom unravisht and gleaming;\\
\idt Mountains your throne, and a river your car;\\
Crash of a bull moose to rouse you from dreaming;\\
\idt Forest your couch, and your candle a star.

You who this faint day the High North is luring\\
\idt Unto her vastness, taintlessly sweet;\\
You who are steel-braced, straight-lipped, enduring,\\
\idt Dreadless in danger and dire in defeat:\\
Honor the High North ever and ever,\\
\idt Whether she crown you, or whether she slay;\\
Suffer her fury, cherish and love her--\\
\idt He who would rule he must learn to obey.

Men of the High North, fierce mountains love you;\\
\idt Proud rivers leap when you ride on their breast.\\
See, the austere sky, pensive above you,\\
\idt Dons all her jewels to smile on your rest.\\
Children of Freedom, scornful of frontiers,\\
\idt We who are weaklings honor your worth.\\
Lords of the wilderness, Princes of Pioneers,\\
\idt Let's have a rouse that will ring round the earth.
