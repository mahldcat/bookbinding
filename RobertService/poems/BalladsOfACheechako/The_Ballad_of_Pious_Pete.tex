\textit{"The North has got him."} --Yukonism.

I tried to refine that neighbor of mine, honest to God, I did.\\
I grieved for his fate, and early and late I watched over him like a kid.\\
I gave him excuse, I bore his abuse in every way that I could;\\
I swore to prevail; I camped on his trail;\\
\idt I plotted and planned for his good.\\
By day and by night I strove in men's sight to gather him into the fold,\\
With precept and prayer, with hope and despair,\\
\idt in hunger and hardship and cold.\\
I followed him into Gehennas of sin, I sat where the sirens sit;\\
In the shade of the Pole, for the sake of his soul,\\
\idt I strove with the powers of the Pit.\\
I shadowed him down to the scrofulous town;\\
\idt I dragged him from dissolute brawls;\\
But I killed the galoot when he started to shoot electricity into my walls.

God knows what I did he should seek to be rid\\
\idt of one who would save him from shame.\\
God knows what I bore that night when he swore\\
\idt and bade me make tracks from his claim.\\
I started to tell of the horrors of hell,\\
\idt when sudden his eyes lit like coals;\\
And "Chuck it," says he, "don't persecute me\\
\idt with your cant and your saving of souls."\\
I'll swear I was mild as I'd be with a child,\\
\idt but he called me the son of a slut;\\
And, grabbing his gun with a leap and a run,\\
\idt he threatened my face with the butt.\\
So what could I do (I leave it to you)?  With curses he harried me forth;\\
Then he was alone, and I was alone, and over us menaced the North.

Our cabins were near; I could see, I could hear;\\
\idt but between us there rippled the creek;\\
And all summer through, with a rancor that grew,\\
\idt he would pass me and never would speak.\\
Then a shuddery breath like the coming of Death\\
\idt crept down from the peaks far away;\\
The water was still; the twilight was chill; the sky was a tatter of gray.\\
Swift came the Big Cold, and opal and gold the lights of the witches arose;\\
The frost-tyrant clinched, and the valley was cinched\\
\idt by the stark and cadaverous snows.\\
The trees were like lace where the star-beams could chase,\\
\idt each leaf was a jewel agleam.\\
The soft white hush lapped the Northland and wrapped\\
\idt us round in a crystalline dream;\\
So still I could hear quite loud in my ear\\
\idt the swish of the pinions of time;\\
So bright I could see, as plain as could be,\\
\idt the wings of God's angels ashine.

As I read in the Book I would oftentimes look\\
\idt to that cabin just over the creek.\\
Ah me, it was sad and evil and bad, two neighbors who never would speak!\\
I knew that full well like a devil in hell\\
\idt he was hatching out, early and late,\\
A system to bear through the frost-spangled air\\
\idt the warm, crimson waves of his hate.\\
I only could peer and shudder and fear--'twas ever so ghastly and still;\\
But I knew over there in his lonely despair\\
\idt he was plotting me terrible ill.\\
I knew that he nursed a malice accurst,\\
\idt like the blast of a winnowing flame;\\
I pleaded aloud for a shield, for a shroud--Oh, God! then calamity came.

Mad!  If I'm mad then you too are mad; but it's all in the point of view.\\
If you'd looked at them things gallivantin' on wings,\\
\idt all purple and green and blue;\\
If you'd noticed them twist, as they mounted and hissed\\
\idt like scorpions dim in the dark;\\
If you'd seen them rebound with a horrible sound,\\
\idt and spitefully spitting a spark;\\
If you'd watched IT with dread, as it hissed by your bed,\\
\idt that thing with the feelers that crawls--\\
You'd have settled the brute that attempted to shoot\\
\idt electricity into your walls.

Oh, some they were blue, and they slithered right through;\\
\idt they were silent and squashy and round;\\
And some they were green; they were wriggly and lean;\\
\idt they writhed with so hateful a sound.\\
My blood seemed to freeze; I fell on my knees;\\
\idt my face was a white splash of dread.\\
Oh, the Green and the Blue, they were gruesome to view;\\
\idt but the worst of them all were the Red.\\
They came through the door, they came through the floor,\\
\idt they came through the moss-creviced logs.\\
They were savage and dire; they were whiskered with fire;\\
\idt they bickered like malamute dogs.\\
They ravined in rings like iniquitous things;\\
\idt they gulped down the Green and the Blue.\\
I crinkled with fear whene'er they drew near,\\
\idt and nearer and nearer they drew.

And then came the crown of Horror's grim crown,\\
\idt the monster so loathsomely red.\\
Each eye was a pin that shot out and in, as, squidlike, it oozed to my bed;\\
So softly it crept with feelers that swept\\
\idt and quivered like fine copper wire;\\
Its belly was white with a sulphurous light,\\
\idt its jaws were a-drooling with fire.\\
It came and it came; I could breathe of its flame,\\
\idt but never a wink could I look.\\
I thrust in its maw the Fount of the Law; I fended it off with the Book.\\
I was weak--oh, so weak--but I thrilled at its shriek,\\
\idt as wildly it fled in the night;\\
And deathlike I lay till the dawn of the day.\\
\idt (Was ever so welcome the light?)

I loaded my gun at the rise of the sun; to his cabin so softly I slunk.\\
My neighbor was there in the frost-freighted air,\\
\idt all wrapped in a robe in his bunk.\\
It muffled his moans; it outlined his bones, as feebly he twisted about;\\
His gums were so black, and his lips seemed to crack,\\
\idt and his teeth all were loosening out.\\
'Twas a death's head that peered through the tangle of beard;\\
\idt 'twas a face I will never forget;\\
Sunk eyes full of woe, and they troubled me so\\
\idt with their pleadings and anguish, and yet\\
As I rested my gaze in a misty amaze on the scurvy-degenerate wreck,\\
I thought of the Things with the dragon-fly wings,\\
\idt then laid I my gun on his neck.\\
He gave out a cry that was faint as a sigh, like a perishing malamute,\\
And he says unto me, "I'm converted," says he;\\
\idt "for Christ's sake, Peter, don't shoot!"

They're taking me out with an escort about, and under a sergeant's care;\\
I am humbled indeed, for I'm 'cuffed to a Swede\\
\idt that thinks he's a millionaire.\\
But it's all Gospel true what I'm telling to you--\\
\idt up there where the Shadow falls--\\
That I settled Sam Noot when he started to shoot electricity into my walls.
