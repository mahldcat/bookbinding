\textit{"The North has got him."} --Yukonism.


 I tried to refine that neighbor of mine, honest to God, I did.
 I grieved for his fate, and early and late I watched over him like a kid.
 I gave him excuse, I bore his abuse in every way that I could;
 I swore to prevail; I camped on his trail;
   I plotted and planned for his good.
 By day and by night I strove in men's sight to gather him into the fold,
 With precept and prayer, with hope and despair,
   in hunger and hardship and cold.
 I followed him into Gehennas of sin, I sat where the sirens sit;
 In the shade of the Pole, for the sake of his soul,
   I strove with the powers of the Pit.
 I shadowed him down to the scrofulous town;
   I dragged him from dissolute brawls;
 But I killed the galoot when he started to shoot electricity into my walls.

 God knows what I did he should seek to be rid
   of one who would save him from shame.
 God knows what I bore that night when he swore
   and bade me make tracks from his claim.
 I started to tell of the horrors of hell,
   when sudden his eyes lit like coals;
 And "Chuck it," says he, "don't persecute me
   with your cant and your saving of souls."
 I'll swear I was mild as I'd be with a child,
   but he called me the son of a slut;
 And, grabbing his gun with a leap and a run,
   he threatened my face with the butt.
 So what could I do (I leave it to you)?  With curses he harried me forth;
 Then he was alone, and I was alone, and over us menaced the North.

 Our cabins were near; I could see, I could hear;
   but between us there rippled the creek;
 And all summer through, with a rancor that grew,
   he would pass me and never would speak.
 Then a shuddery breath like the coming of Death
   crept down from the peaks far away;
 The water was still; the twilight was chill; the sky was a tatter of gray.
 Swift came the Big Cold, and opal and gold the lights of the witches arose;
 The frost-tyrant clinched, and the valley was cinched
   by the stark and cadaverous snows.
 The trees were like lace where the star-beams could chase,
   each leaf was a jewel agleam.
 The soft white hush lapped the Northland and wrapped
   us round in a crystalline dream;
 So still I could hear quite loud in my ear
   the swish of the pinions of time;
 So bright I could see, as plain as could be,
   the wings of God's angels ashine.

 As I read in the Book I would oftentimes look
   to that cabin just over the creek.
 Ah me, it was sad and evil and bad, two neighbors who never would speak!
 I knew that full well like a devil in hell
   he was hatching out, early and late,
 A system to bear through the frost-spangled air
   the warm, crimson waves of his hate.
 I only could peer and shudder and fear--'twas ever so ghastly and still;
 But I knew over there in his lonely despair
   he was plotting me terrible ill.
 I knew that he nursed a malice accurst,
   like the blast of a winnowing flame;
 I pleaded aloud for a shield, for a shroud--Oh, God! then calamity came.

 Mad!  If I'm mad then you too are mad; but it's all in the point of view.
 If you'd looked at them things gallivantin' on wings,
   all purple and green and blue;
 If you'd noticed them twist, as they mounted and hissed
   like scorpions dim in the dark;
 If you'd seen them rebound with a horrible sound,
   and spitefully spitting a spark;
 If you'd watched IT with dread, as it hissed by your bed,
   that thing with the feelers that crawls--
 You'd have settled the brute that attempted to shoot
   electricity into your walls.

 Oh, some they were blue, and they slithered right through;
   they were silent and squashy and round;
 And some they were green; they were wriggly and lean;
   they writhed with so hateful a sound.
 My blood seemed to freeze; I fell on my knees;
   my face was a white splash of dread.
 Oh, the Green and the Blue, they were gruesome to view;
   but the worst of them all were the Red.
 They came through the door, they came through the floor,
   they came through the moss-creviced logs.
 They were savage and dire; they were whiskered with fire;
   they bickered like malamute dogs.
 They ravined in rings like iniquitous things;
   they gulped down the Green and the Blue.
 I crinkled with fear whene'er they drew near,
   and nearer and nearer they drew.

 And then came the crown of Horror's grim crown,
   the monster so loathsomely red.
 Each eye was a pin that shot out and in, as, squidlike, it oozed to my bed;
 So softly it crept with feelers that swept
   and quivered like fine copper wire;
 Its belly was white with a sulphurous light,
   its jaws were a-drooling with fire.
 It came and it came; I could breathe of its flame,
   but never a wink could I look.
 I thrust in its maw the Fount of the Law; I fended it off with the Book.
 I was weak--oh, so weak--but I thrilled at its shriek,
   as wildly it fled in the night;
 And deathlike I lay till the dawn of the day.
   (Was ever so welcome the light?)

 I loaded my gun at the rise of the sun; to his cabin so softly I slunk.
 My neighbor was there in the frost-freighted air,
   all wrapped in a robe in his bunk.
 It muffled his moans; it outlined his bones, as feebly he twisted about;
 His gums were so black, and his lips seemed to crack,
   and his teeth all were loosening out.
 'Twas a death's head that peered through the tangle of beard;
   'twas a face I will never forget;
 Sunk eyes full of woe, and they troubled me so
   with their pleadings and anguish, and yet
 As I rested my gaze in a misty amaze on the scurvy-degenerate wreck,
 I thought of the Things with the dragon-fly wings,
   then laid I my gun on his neck.
 He gave out a cry that was faint as a sigh, like a perishing malamute,
 And he says unto me, "I'm converted," says he;
   "for Christ's sake, Peter, don't shoot!"

  *****

 They're taking me out with an escort about, and under a sergeant's care;
 I am humbled indeed, for I'm 'cuffed to a Swede
   that thinks he's a millionaire.
 But it's all Gospel true what I'm telling to you--
   up there where the Shadow falls--
 That I settled Sam Noot when he started to shoot electricity into my walls.
