\poemchapter{L'Envoi}

\begin{poemblock}
We talked of yesteryears, of trails and treasure,\\
\idt Of men who played the game and lost or won;\\
Of mad stampedes, of toil beyond all measure,\\
\idt Of camp-fire comfort when the day was done.\\
We talked of sullen nights by moon-dogs haunted,\\
\idt Of bird and beast and tree, of rod and gun;\\
Of boat and tent, of hunting-trip enchanted\\
\idt Beneath the wonder of the midnight sun;\\
Of bloody-footed dogs that gnawed the traces,\\
\idt Of prisoned seas, wind-lashed and winter-locked;\\
The ice-gray dawn was pale upon our faces,\\
\idt Yet still we filled the cup and still we talked.

The city street was dimmed.\idt We saw the glitter\\
\idt Of moon-picked brilliants on the virgin snow,\\
And down the drifted canyon heard the bitter,\\
\idt Relentless slogan of the winds of woe.\\
The city was forgot, and, parka-skirted,\\
\idt We trod that leagueless land that once we knew;\\
We saw stream past, down valleys glacier-girted,\\
\idt The wolf-worn legions of the caribou.\\
We smoked our pipes, o'er scenes of triumph dwelling;\\
\idt Of deeds of daring, dire defeats, we talked;\\
And other tales that lost not in the telling,\\
\idt Ere to our beds uncertainly we walked.

And so, dear friends, in gentler valleys roaming,\\
\idt Perhaps, when on my printed page you look,\\
Your fancies by the firelight may go homing\\
\idt To that lone land that haply you forsook.\\
And if perchance you hear the silence calling,\\
\idt The frozen music of star-yearning heights,\\
Or, dreaming, see the seines of silver trawling\\
\idt Across the sky's abyss on vasty nights,\\
You may recall that sweep of savage splendor,\\
\idt That land that measures each man at his worth,\\
And feel in memory, half fierce, half tender,\\
\idt  The brotherhood of men that know the North.
