\poemchapter{To the Man of the High North}

\begin{poemblock}
My rhymes are rough, and often in my rhyming\\
\idt I've drifted, silver-sailed, on seas of dream,\\
Hearing afar the bells of Elfland chiming,\\
\idt Seeing the groves of Arcadie agleam.

I was the thrall of Beauty that rejoices\\
\idt From peak snow-diademed to regal star;\\
Yet to mine aerie ever pierced the voices,\\
\idt The pregnant voices of the Things That Are.

The Here, the Now, the vast Forlorn around us;\\
\idt The gold-delirium, the ferine strife;\\
The lusts that lure us on, the hates that hound us;\\
\idt Our red rags in the patch-work quilt of Life.

The nameless men who nameless rivers travel,\\
\idt And in strange valleys greet strange deaths alone;\\
\idt The grim, intrepid ones who would unravel\\
The mysteries that shroud the Polar Zone.

These will I sing, and if one of you linger\\
\idt Over my pages in the Long, Long Night,\\
And on some lone line lay a calloused finger,\\
\idt Saying:  "It's human-true--it hits me right";\\
Then will I count this loving toil well spent;\\
Then will I dream awhile--content, content.
