\poemchapter{My Madonna}

\begin{poemblock}
I haled me a woman from the street,\\
\idt Shameless, but, oh, so fair!\\
I bade her sit in the model's seat,\\
\idt And I painted her sitting there.

\indentedblockns{
I hid all trace of her heart unclean;\\
\idt I painted a babe at her breast;\\
I painted her as she might have been\\
\idt If the Worst had been the Best.
}

She laughed at my picture, and went away.\\
\idt Then came, with a knowing nod,\\
A connoisseur, and I heard him say:\\
\idt "'Tis Mary, the Mother of God."

\indentedblockns{
So I painted a halo round her hair,\\
\idt And I sold her, and took my fee,\\
And she hangs in the church of Saint Hilaire,\\
\idt Where you and all may see.
}
