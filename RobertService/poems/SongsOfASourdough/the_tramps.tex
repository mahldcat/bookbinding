\poemchapter{The Tramps}

\begin{poemblock}
Can you recall, dear comrade, when we tramped\\
\idt God's land together,\\
And we sang the old, old Earth-song, for our\\
\idt youth was very sweet;\\
When we drank and fought and lusted, as we\\
\idt mocked at tie and tether,\\
Along the road to Anywhere, the wide world at\\
\idt our feet.

Along the road to Anywhere, when each day had\\
\idt its story;\\
When time was yet our vassal, and life's jest\\
\idt was still unstale;\\
When peace unfathomed filled our hearts as,\\
\idt bathed in amber glory,\\
Along the road to Anywhere we watched the\\
\idt sunsets pale.

Alas! the road to Anywhere is pitfalled with\\
\idt disaster;\\
There's hunger, want, and weariness, yet oh,\\
\idt we loved it so!\\
As on we tramped exultantly, and no man was\\
\idt our master,\\
And no man guessed what dreams were ours,\\
\idt as swinging heel and toe,\\
We tramped the road to Anywhere, the magic\\
\idt road to Anywhere,\\
The tragic road to Anywhere, such dear, dim\\
\idt years ago.
