\poemchapter{The Younger Son}

\begin{poemblock}
If you leave the gloom of London and you seek a glowing land,\\
\idt Where all except the flag is strange and new,\\
There's a bronzed and stalwart fellow who will grip you by the hand,\\
\idt And greet you with a welcome warm and true;\\
For he's your younger brother, the one you sent away,\\
\idt Because there wasn't room for him at home;\\
And now he's quite contented, and he's glad he didn't stay,\\
\idt And he's building Britain's greatness o'er the foam.

When the giant herd is moving at the rising of the sun,\\
\idt And the prairie is lit with rose and gold;\\
And the camp is all a-bustle, and the busy day's begun,\\
\idt He leaps into the saddle sure and bold.\\
Through the round of heat and hurry, through the racket and the rout,\\
\idt He rattles at a pace that nothing mars;\\
And when the night-winds whisper, and camp-fires flicker out,\\
\idt He is sleeping like a child beneath the stars.

When the wattle-blooms are drooping in the sombre she-oak glade,\\
\idt And the breathless land is lying in a swoon,\\
He leaves his work a moment, leaning lightly on his spade,\\
\idt And he hears the bell-bird chime the Austral noon.\\
The parakeets are silent in the gum-tree by the creek;\\
\idt The ferny grove is sunshine-steeped and still;\\
But the dew will gem the myrtle in the twilight ere he seek\\
\idt His little lonely cabin on the hill.

Around the purple, vine-clad slope the argent river dreams;\\
\idt The roses almost hide the house from view;\\
A snow-peak of the Winterberg in crimson splendour gleams;\\
\idt The shadow deepens down on the karroo.\\
He seeks the lily-scented dusk beneath the orange-tree:\\
\idt His pipe in silence glows and fades and glows,\\
And then two little maids come out and climb upon his knee,\\
\idt And one is like the lily, one the rose.

He sees his white sheep dapple o'er the green New Zealand plain,\\
\idt And where Vancouver's shaggy ramparts frown,\\
When the sunlight threads the pine-gloom he is fighting might and main\\
\idt To clinch the rivets of an Empire down.\\
You will find him toiling, toiling, in the south or in the west,\\
\idt A child of nature, fearless, frank and free;\\
And the warmest heart that beats for you is beating in his breast,\\
\idt And he sends you loyal greeting o'er the sea.

You've a brother in the Army, you've another in the Church;\\
\idt One of you is a diplomatic swell;\\
You've had the pick of everything and left him in the lurch;\\
\idt And yet I think he's doing very well.\\
I'm sure his life is happy, and he doesn't envy yours;\\
\idt I know he loves the land his pluck has won;\\
And I fancy in the years unborn, while England's fame endures,\\
\idt She will come to bless with prideâ€”the Younger Son.
