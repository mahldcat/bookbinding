\poemchapter{Comfort}


\begin{verse}
Say! You've struck a heap of trouble—\\
\hspace*{3em}Bust in business, lost your wife;\\
No one cares a cent about you,\\
\hspace*{3em}You don't care a cent for life;\\
Hard luck has of hope bereft you,\\
\hspace*{3em}Health is failing, wish you'd die—\\
Why, you've still the sunshine left you,\\
\hspace*{3em}And the big, blue sky.

\hspace*{6em}Sky so blue it makes you wonder\\
\hspace*{9em}If it's heaven shining through;\\
\hspace*{6em}Earth so smiling 'way out yonder,\\
\hspace*{9em}Sun so bright it dazzles you;\\
\hspace*{6em}Birds a-singing, flowers a-flinging\\
\hspace*{9em}All their fragrance on the breeze;\\
\hspace*{6em}Dancing shadows, green, still meadows—\\
\hspace*{9em}Don't you mope, you've still got these.

These, and none can take them from you;\\
\hspace*{3em}These, and none can weigh their worth.\\
What! you're tired and broke and beaten?—\\
\hspace*{3em}Why, you're rich—you've got the earth!\\
Yes, if you're a tramp in tatters,\\
\hspace*{3em}While the blue sky bends above,\\
You've got nearly all that matters,\\
\hspace*{3em}You've got God, and God is love.

\end{verse}
