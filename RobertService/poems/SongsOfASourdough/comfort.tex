\poemchapter{Comfort}


\begin{poemblock}
Say! You've struck a heap of trouble—\\
\idt  Bust in business, lost your wife;\\
No one cares a cent about you,\\
\idt You don't care a cent for life;\\
Hard luck has of hope bereft you,\\
\idt Health is failing, wish you'd die—\\
Why, you've still the sunshine left you,\\
\idt And the big, blue sky.

\indentedblockns{
Sky so blue it makes you wonder\\
\idt If it's heaven shining through;\\
Earth so smiling 'way out yonder,\\
\idt Sun so bright it dazzles you;\\
Birds a-singing, flowers a-flinging\\
\idt All their fragrance on the breeze;\\
Dancing shadows, green, still meadows—\\
\idt Don't you mope, you've still got these.
}

These, and none can take them from you;\\
\idt These, and none can weigh their worth.\\
What! you're tired and broke and beaten?—\\
\idt Why, you're rich—you've got the earth!\\
Yes, if you're a tramp in tatters,\\
\idt While the blue sky bends above,\\
You've got nearly all that matters,\\
\idt You've got God, and God is love.
