\poemchapter{The Cremation of Sam McGee}

\begin{poemblock}
\textit{
There are strange things done in the midnight sun\\
\idt By the men who moil for gold;\\
The Arctic trails have their secret tales\\
\idt That would make your blood run cold;\\
The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,\\
\idt But the queerest they ever did see\\
Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge\\
\idt I cremated Sam McGee.
}

Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee,\\
\idt Where the cotton blooms and blows.\\
Why he left his home in the South to roam\\
\idt ‘Round the Pole, God only knows.\\
He was always cold, but the land of gold\\
\idt Seemed to hold him like a spell;\\
Though he’d often say in his homely way\\
\idt That “he’d sooner live in hell.”

On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way\\
\idt Over the Dawson trail.\\
Talk of your cold!—through the parka’s fold\\
\idt It stabbed like a driven nail.\\
If our eyes we’d close, then the lashes froze\\
\idt Till sometimes we couldn’t see;\\
It wasn’t much fun, but the only one\\
\idt To whimper was Sam McGee.

And that very night, as we lay packed tight\\
\idt In our robes beneath the snow,\\
And the dogs were fed, and the stars o’erhead\\
\idt Were dancing heel and toe,\\
He turned to me, and “Cap,” says he,\\
\idt “I’ll cash in this trip, I guess;\\
And if I do, I’m asking that you\\
\idt Won’t refuse my last request.”

Well, he seemed so low that I couldn’t say no;\\
\idt Then he says with a sort of moan:\\
“It’s the cursed cold, and it’s got right hold\\
\idt Till I’m chilled clean through to the bone.\\
Yet ‘tain’t being dead—it’s my awful dread\\
\idt Of the icy grave that pains;\\
So I want you to swear that, foul or fair,\\
\idt You’ll cremate my last remains.”

A pal’s last need is a thing to heed,\\
\idt So I swore I would not fail;\\
And we started on at the streak of dawn,\\
\idt But God! he looked ghastly pale.\\
He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day\\
\idt Of his home in Tennessee;\\
And before nightfall a corpse was all\\
\idt That was left of Sam McGee.

There wasn’t a breath in that land of death,\\
\idt And I hurried, horror-driven,\\
With a corpse half hid that I couldn’t get rid,\\
\idt Because of a promise given;\\
It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say:\\
\idt “You may tax your brawn and brains,\\
But you promised true, and it’s up to you\\
\idt To cremate those last remains.”

Now a promise made is a debt unpaid,\\
\idt And the trail has its own stern code.\\
In the days to come, though my lips were dumb,\\
\idt In my heart how I cursed that load.\\
In the long, long night, by the lone firelight,\\
\idt While the huskies, round in a ring,\\
Howled out their woes to the homeless snows—\\
\idt O God! how I loathed the thing.

And every day that quiet clay\\
\idt Seemed to heavy and heavier grow;\\
And on I went, though the dogs were spent\\
\idt And the grub was getting low;\\
The trail was bad, and I felt half mad,\\
\idt But I swore I would not give in;\\
And I’d often sing to the hateful thing,\\
\idt And it hearkened with a grin.

Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge,\\
\idt And a derelict there lay;\\
It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice\\
\idt It was called the “Alice May.”\\
And I looked at it, and I thought a bit,\\
\idt And I looked at my frozen chum;\\
Then “Here,” said I, with a sudden cry,\\
\idt “Is my crematorium.”

Some planks I tore from the cabin floor,\\
\idt And I lit the boiler fire;\\
Some coal I found that was lying around,\\
\hspace*{3em}And I heaped the fuel higher;\\
The flames just soared, and the furnace roared—\\
\idt Such a blaze you seldom see;\\
And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal,\\
\idt And I stuffed in Sam McGee.

Then I made a hike, for I didn’t like\\
\idt To hear him sizzle so;\\
And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled,\\
\idt And the wind began to blow.\\
It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled\\
\idt Down my cheeks, and I don’t know why;\\
And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak\\
\idt Went streaking down the sky.

I do not know how long in the snow\\
\idt I wrestled with grisly fear;\\
But the stars came out and they danced about\\
\idt Ere again I ventured near;\\
I was sick with dread, but I bravely said:\\
\idt “I’ll just take a peep inside.\\
I guess he’s cooked, and it’s time I looked.”\\
\idt ... Then the door I opened wide.

And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm,\\
\idt In the heart of the furnace roar;\\
And he wore a smile you could see a mile,\\
\idt And he said: “Please close that door.\\
It’s fine in here, but I greatly fear\\
\idt You’ll let in the cold and storm—\\
Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee,\\
\idt It’s the first time I’ve been warm.”

\textit{
There are strange things done in the midnight sun\\
\idt By the men who moil for gold;\\
The Arctic trails have their secret tales\\
\idt That would make your blood run cold;\\
The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,\\
\idt But the queerest they ever did see\\
Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge\\
\idt I cremated Sam McGee.
