\poemchapter{Music in the Bush}

\begin{poemblock}
O'er the dark pines she sees the silver moon,\\
\idt And in the west, all tremulous, a star;\\
And soothing sweet she hears the mellow tune\\
\idt Of cow-bells jangled in the fields afar.

Quite listless, for her daily stent is done,\\
\idt She stands, sad exile, at her rose-wreathed door,\\
And sends her love eternal with the sun\\
\idt That goes to gild the land she'll see no more.

The grave, gaunt pines imprison her sad gaze,\\
\idt All still the sky and darkling drearily;\\
She feels the chilly breath of dear, dead days\\
\idt Come sifting through the alders eerily.

Oh, how the roses riot in their bloom!\\
\idt The curtains stir as with an ancient pain;\\
Her old piano gleams from out the gloom,\\
\idt And waits and waits her tender touch in vain.

But now her hands like moonlight brush the keys\\
\idt With velvet grace, melodious delight;\\
And now a sad refrain from overseas\\
\idt Goes sobbing on the bosom of the night.

And now she sings. (O singer in the gloom,\\
\idt Voicing a sorrow we can ne'er express,\\
Here in the Farness where we few have room\\
\idt Unshamed to show our love and tenderness,

Our hearts will echo, till they beat no more,\\
\idt That song of sadness and of motherland;\\
And stretched in deathless love to England's shore,\\
\idt Some day she'll hearken and she'll understand.)

A prima-donna in the shining past,\\
\idt But now a mother growing old and grey,\\
She thinks of how she held a people fast\\
\idt In thrall, and gleaned the triumphs of a day.

She sees a sea of faces like a dream;\\
\idt She sees herself a queen of song once more;\\
She sees lips part in rapture, eyes agleam;\\
\idt She sings as never once she sang before.

She sings a wild, sweet song that throbs with pain,\\
\idt The added pain of life that transcends art,\\
A song of home, a deep, celestial strain,\\
\idt The glorious swan-song of a dying heart.

A lame tramp comes along the railway track,\\
\idt A grizzled dog whose day is nearly done:\\
He passes, pauses, then comes slowly back\\
\idt And listens there—an audience of one.

She sings—her golden voice is passion-fraught\\
\idt As when she charmed a thousand eager ears;\\
He listens trembling, and she knows it not,\\
\idt And down his hollow cheeks roll bitter tears.

She ceases and is still, as if to pray;\\
\idt There is no sound, the stars are all alight—\\
Only a wretch who stumbles on his way,\\
\idt Only a vagrant sobbing in the night.
