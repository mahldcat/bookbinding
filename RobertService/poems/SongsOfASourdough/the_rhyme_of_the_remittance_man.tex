\poemchapter{The Rhyme of the Remittance Man}

\begin{poemblock}
There's a four-pronged buck a-swinging in the shadow of my cabin,\\
\idt And it roamed the velvet valley till to-day;\\
But I tracked it by the river, and I trailed it in the cover,\\
\idt And I killed it on the mountain miles away.\\
Now I've had my lazy supper, and the level sun is gleaming\\
\idt On the water where the silver salmon play;\\
And I light my little corn-cob, and I linger softly dreaming,\\
\idt \idt In the twilight, of a land that's far away.

Far away, so faint and far, is flaming London, fevered Paris,\\
\idt That I fancy I have gained another star;\\
Far away the din and hurry, far away the sin and worry,\\
\idt Far away—God knows they cannot be too far.\\
Gilded galley-slaves of Mammon—how my purse-proud brothers taunt me!\\
\idt I might have been as well-to-do as they\\
Had I clutched like them my chances, learned their wisdom, crushed my fancies,\\
\idt Starved my soul and gone to business every day.

Well, the cherry bends with blossom, and the vivid grass is springing,\\
\idt And the star-like lily nestles in the green;\\
And the frogs their joys are singing, and my heart in tune is ringing,\\
\idt And it doesn't matter what I might have been,\\
While above the scented pine-gloom, piling heights of golden glory,\\
\idt The sun-god paints his canvas in the west;\\
I can couch me deep in clover, I can listen to the story\\
\idt Of the lazy, lapping water—it is best.

While the trout leaps in the river, and the blue grouse thrills the cover,\\
\idt And the frozen snow betrays the panther's track,\\
And the robin greets the dayspring with the rapture of a lover,\\
\idt I am happy, and I'll nevermore go back. \\
For I know I'd just be longing for the little old log cabin,\\
\idt With the morning-glory clinging to the door,\\
Till I loathed the city places, cursed the care on all the faces,\\
\idt Turned my back on lazar London evermore.

So send me far from Lombard Street, and write me down a failure;\\
\idt Put a little in my purse and leave me free.\\
Say: "He turned from Fortune's offering to follow up a pale lure,\\
\idt He is one of us no longer—let him be."\\
I am one of you no longer: by the trails my feet have broken,\\
\idt The dizzy peaks I've scaled, the camp-fire's glow,\\
By the lonely seas I've sailed in—yea, the final word is spoken,\\
\idt I am signed and sealed to nature. Be it so.
