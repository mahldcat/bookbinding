\poemchapter{The Three Voices}

\begin{poemblock}
The waves have a story to tell me,\\
\idt As I lie on the lonely beach;\\
Chanting aloft in the pine-tops,\\
\idt The wind has a lesson to teach;\\
But the stars sing an anthem of glory\\
\idt I cannot put into speech.

The waves tell of ocean spaces,\\
\idt Of hearts that are wild and brave,\\
Of populous city places,\\
\idt Of desolate shores they lave;\\
Of men who sally in quest of gold\\
\idt To sink in an ocean grave.

The wind is a mighty roamer;\\
\idt He bids me keep me free,\\
Clean from the taint of the gold-lust,\\
\idt Hardy and pure as he;\\
Cling with my love to nature\\
\idt As a child to the mother-knee.

But the stars throng out in their glory,\\
\idt And they sing of the God in man;\\
They sing of the mighty Master,\\
\idt Of the loom His fingers span;\\
Where a star or a soul is a part of the whole,\\
\idt And weft in the wondrous plan.

Here by the camp-fire's flicker,\\
\idt Deep in my blanket curled,\\
I long for the peace of the pine-gloom\\
\idt When the scroll of the Lord is unfurled,\\
And the wind and the wave are silent,\\
\idt And world is singing to world.
