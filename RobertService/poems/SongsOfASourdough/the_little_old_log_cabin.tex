\poemchapter{The Little Old Log Cabin}

\begin{poemblock}
When a man gits on his uppers in a hard-pan sort of town,\\
\idt An' he ain't got nothin' comin', an' he can't afford ter eat,\\
An' he's in a fix fer lodgin', an' he wanders up an' down,\\
\idt An' you'd fancy he'd been boozin', he's so locoed 'bout the feet;\\
When he's feelin' sneakin' sorry, an' his belt is hangin' slack,\\
\idt An' his face is peaked an' grey-like, an' his heart gits down an' whines,\\
Then he's apt ter git a-thinkin' an' a-wishin' he was back\\
\idt In the little ol' log cabin in the shadder of the pines.

When he's on the blazin' desert, an' his canteen's sprung a leak,\\
\idt An' he's all alone an' crazy, an' he's crawlin' like a snail,\\
An' his tongue's so black an' swollen that it hurts him fer to speak,\\
\idt An' he gouges down fer water, an' the raven's on his trail;\\
When he's done with care and cursin', an' he feels more like to cry,\\
\idt An' he sees ol' Death a-grinnin', an' he thinks upon his crimes,\\
Then he's like ter hev' a vision, as he settles down ter die,\\
\idt Of the little ol' log cabin an' the roses an' the vines.

Oh, the little ol' log cabin, it's a solemn shinin' mark\\
\idt When a feller gits ter sinnin', an' a-goin' ter the wall,\\
An' folks don't understand him, an' he's gropin' in the dark,\\
\idt An' he's sick of bein' cursed at, an' he's longin' fer his call:\\
When the sun of life's a-sinkin' you can see it 'way above,\\
\idt On the hill from out the shadder in a glory 'gin the sky,\\
An' your mother's voice is callin', an' her arms are stretched in love,\\
\idt An' somehow you're glad you're goin', an' you ain't a-scared to die;\\
When you'll be like a kid again, an' nestle to her breast,\\
\idt An' never leave its shelter, an' forget, an' love, an' rest.
