\poemchapter{Unforgotten}

\begin{poemblock}
I know a garden where the lilies gleam,\\
\idt And one who lingers in the sunshine there;\\
She is than white-stoled lily far more fair,\\
\idt And oh, her eyes are heaven-lit with dream.

\indentedblockns{
I know a garret, cold and dark and drear,\\
\idt And one who toils and toils with tireless pen,\\
Until his brave, sad eyes grow wearyâ€”then\\
\idt He seeks the stars, pale, silent as a seer.
}

And ah, it's strange, for desolate and dim\\
\idt Between these two there rolls an ocean wide;\\
Yet he is in the garden by her side,\\
\idt And she is in the garret there with him.
