\poemchapter{The Heart of the Sourdough}

\begin{poemblock}
There where the mighty mountains bare their fangs unto the moon;\\
There where the sullen sun-dogs glare in the snow-bright, bitter noon,\\
And the glacier-gutted streams sweep down at the clarion call of June:

There where the livid tundras keep their tryst with the tranquil snows;\\
There where the Silences are spawned, and the light of hell-fire flows\\
Into the bowl of the midnight sky, violet, amber, and rose:

There where the rapids churn and roar, and the ice-floes bellowing run;\\
Where the tortured, twisted rivers of blood rush to the setting sun—\\
I've packed my kit and I'm going, boys, ere another day is done.

I knew it would call, or soon or late, as it calls the whirring wings;\\
It's the olden lure, it's the golden lure, it's the lure of the timeless things;\\
And to-night, O God of the trails untrod, how it whines in my heart-strings!

I'm sick to death of your well-groomed gods, your make-believe and your show;\\
I long for a whiff of bacon and beans, a snug shake-down in the snow,\\
A trail to break, and a life at stake, and another bout with the foe;

With the raw-ribbed Wild that abhors all life, the wild that would crush and rend;\\
I have clinched and closed with the naked North, I have learned to defy and defend;\\
Shoulder to shoulder we've fought it out—yet the Wild must win in the end.

I have flouted the Wild. I have followed its lure, fearless, familiar, alone;\\
By all that the battle means and makes I claim that land for mine own;\\
Yet the Wild must win, and a day will come when I shall be overthrown.

Then when as wolf-dogs fight we've fought, the lean wolf-land and I;\\
Fought and bled till the snows are red under the reeling sky;\\
Even as lean wolf-dog goes down will I go down and die.
