\poemchapter{The Lone Trail}

\begin{poemblock}
\textit{
Ye who know the Lone Trail fain would follow it,\\
\idt Though it lead to glory or the darkness of the pit.\\
Ye who take the Lone Trail, bid your love good-bye;\\
\idt The Lone Trail, the Lone Trail follow till you die.
}

The trails of the world be countless, and most of the trails be tried;\\
\idt You tread on the heels of the many, till you come where the ways divide;\\
And one lies safe in the sunlight, and the other is dreary and wan,\\
\idt Yet you look aslant at the Lone Trail, and the Lone Trail lures you on.\\
And somehow you're sick of the highway, with its noise and its easy needs,\\
\idt And you seek the risk of the by-way, and you reck not where it leads.\\
And sometimes it leads to the desert, and the tongue swells out of the mouth,\\
\idt And you stagger blind to the mirage, to die in the mocking drouth.\\
And sometimes it leads to the mountain, to the light of the lone camp-fire,\\
\idt And you gnaw your belt in the anguish of hunger-goaded desire.\\
And sometimes it leads to the Southland, to the swamp where the orchid glows,\\
\idt And you rave to your grave with the fever, and they rob the corpse for its clothes.\\
And sometimes it leads to the Northland, and the scurvy softens your bones,\\
\idt And your flesh dints in like putty, and you spit out your teeth like stones.\\
And sometimes it leads to a coral reef in the wash of a weedy sea,\\
\idt And you sit and stare at the empty glare where the gulls wait greedily.\\
And sometimes it leads to an Arctic trail, and the snows where your torn feet freeze,\\
\idt And you whittle away the useless clay, and crawl on your hands and knees.\\
Often it leads to the dead-pit; always it leads to pain;\\
\idt By the bones of your brothers ye know it, but oh, to follow you're fain.\\
By your bones they will follow behind you, till the ways of the world are made plain.

\textit{
Bid good-bye to sweetheart, bid good-bye to friend;\\
\idt The Lone Trail, the Lone Trail follow to the end.\\
Tarry not, and fear not, chosen of the true;\\
\idt Lover of the Lone Trail, the Lone Trail waits for you.
}
