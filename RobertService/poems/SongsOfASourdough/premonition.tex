\poemchapter{Premonition}


\begin{poemblock}
'Twas a year ago and the moon was bright\\
\idt (Oh, I remember so well, so well),\\
I walked with my love in a sea of light,\\
\idt And the voice of my sweet was a silver bell.

\indentedblockns{
And sudden the moon grew strangely dull,\\
\idt And sudden my love had taken wing;\\
I looked on the face of a grinning skull,\\
\idt I strained to my heart a ghastly thing.
}

'Twas but fantasy, for my love lay still\\
\idt In my arms with her tender eyes aglow,\\
And she wondered why my lips were chill,\\
\idt Why I was silent and kissed her so.

\indentedblockns{
A year has gone and the moon is bright,\\
\idt A gibbous moon like a ghost of woe;\\
I sit by a new-made grave to-night,\\
\idt And my heart is brokenâ€”it's strange, you know.
}
