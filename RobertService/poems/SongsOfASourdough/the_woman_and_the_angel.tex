\poemchapter{The Woman And The Angel}


\begin{poemblock}
An angel was tired of heaven, as he lounged in\\
\idt the golden street;\\
His halo was tilted sideways, and his harp lay\\
\idt mute at his feet;\\
So the Master stooped in His pity, and gave him\\
\idt a pass to go,\\
For the space of a moon, to the earth-world, to\\
\idt mix with the men below.

He doffed his celestial garments, scarce waiting\\
\idt to lay them straight;\\
He bade goodbye to Peter, who stood by the\\
\idt golden gate;\\
The sexless singers of heaven chanted a fond\\
\idt farewell,\\
And the imps looked up as they pattered on the\\
\idt red-hot flags of hell.

Never was seen such an angel: eyes of a heavenly\\
\idt blue,\\
Features that shamed Apollo, hair of a golden\\
\idt hue;\\
The women simply adored him, his lips were like\\
\idt Cupid's bow;\\
But he never ventured to use them—and so they\\
\idt voted him slow.

Till at last there came One Woman, a marvel of\\
\idt loveliness,\\
And she whispered to him: "Do you love me?"\\
\idt And he answered that woman, "Yes."\\
And she said: "Put your arms around me, and\\
\idt kiss me, and hold me—so—"\\
But fiercely he drew back, saying: "This thing\\
\idt is wrong, and I know."

Then sweetly she mocked his scruples, and softly\\
\idt she him beguiled:\\
"You, who are verily man among men, speak\\
\idt with the tongue of a child.\\
We have outlived the old standards; we have\\
\idt burst, like an over-tight thong,\\
The ancient, outworn, puritanic traditions of\\
\idt Right and Wrong."

Then the Master feared for His angel, and called\\
\idt him again to His side,\\
For oh, the woman was wondrous, and oh, the\\
\idt angel was tried.\\
And deep in his hell sang the Devil, and this was\\
\idt the strain of his song:\\
"The ancient, outworn, puritanic traditions of\\
\idt Right and Wrong."
