\poemchapter{New Year's Eve}

\begin{poemblock}
It's cruel cold on the water-front, silent and dark and drear;\\
\idt Only the black tide weltering, only the hissing snow;\\
And I, alone, like a storm-tossed wreck, on this night of the glad New Year,\\
\idt Shuffling along in the icy wind, ghastly and gaunt and slow.

They're playing a tune in McGuffy's saloon, and it's cheery and bright in there\\
\idt (God! but I'm weak—since the bitter dawn, and never a bite of food);\\
I'll just go over and slip inside—I mustn't give way to despair—\\
\idt Perhaps I can bum a little booze if the boys are feeling good.

They'll jeer at me, and they'll sneer at me, and they'll call me a whiskey soak;\\
\idt ("Have a drink? Well, thankee kindly, sir, I don't mind if I do.")\\
A drivelling, dirty gin-joint fiend, the butt of the bar-room joke;\\
\idt Sunk and sodden and hopeless—"Another? Well, here's to you!"

McGuffy is showing a bunch of the boys how Bob Fitzsimmons hit;\\
\idt The barman is talking of Tammany Hall, and why the ward boss got fired;\\
I'll just sneak into a corner, and they'll let me alone a bit;\\
\idt The room is reeling round and round ... O God, but I'm tired, I'm tired....

Roses she wore on her breast that night. Oh, but their scent was sweet;\\
\idt Alone we sat on the balcony, and the fan-palms arched above;\\
The witching strain of a waltz by Strauss came up to our cool retreat,\\
\idt And I prisoned her little hand in mine, and I whispered my plea of love.

Then sudden the laughter died on her lips, and lowly she bent her head;\\
\idt And oh, there came in the deep, dark eyes a look that was heaven to see\\
And the moments went, and I waited there, and never a word was said,\\
\idt And she plucked from her bosom a rose of red, and shyly gave it to me.

Then the music swelled to a crash of joy, and the lights blazed up like day;\\
\idt And I held her fast to my throbbing heart, and I kissed her bonny brow;\\
"She is mine, she is mine for evermore!" the violins seemed to say,\\
\idt And the bells were ringing the New Year in—O God! I can hear them now.

Don't you remember that long, last waltz, with its sobbing, sad refrain?\\
\idt Don't you remember that last goodbye, and the dear eyes dim with tears?\\
Don't you remember that golden dream, with never a hint of pain,\\
\idt Of lives that would blend like an angel-song in the bliss of the coming year?

Oh, what have I lost! What have I lost! Ethel, forgive, forgive!\\
\idt The red, red rose is faded now, and it's fifty years ago.\\
'Twere better to die a thousand deaths than live each day as I live!\\
\idt I have sinned, I have sunk to the lowest depths—but oh, I have suffered so!

Hark! Oh hark! I can hear the bells!... Look! I can see her there,\\
\idt Fair as a dream ...but it fades ... And now—I can hear the dreadful hum\\
Of the crowded court ... See! the Judge looks down ...\\
\idt Not Guilty, my Lord, I swear ...\\
\idt The bells, I can hear the bells again ...\\
\idt Ethel, I come, I come!...

"Rouse up, old man, it's twelve o'clock. You can't sleep here, you know.\\
\idt Say! ain't you got no sentiment? Lift up your muddled head;\\
Have a drink to the glad New Year, a drop before you go—\\
\idt You darned old dirty hobo ... My God! Here, boys! He's DEAD!"
