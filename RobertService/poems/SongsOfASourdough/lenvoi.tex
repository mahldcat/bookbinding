\poemchapter{L'Envoi}


\begin{poemblock}

\textit{
You who have lived in the Land,\\
\idt You who have trusted the trail;\\
You who are strong to withstand,\\
\idt You who are swift to assail;\\
Songs have I sung to beguile,\\
\idt Vintage of desperate years\\
Hard as a harlot's smile,\\
\idt Bitter as unshed tears.
}

\indentedblock\itshape{
Little of joy or mirth,\\
\idt Little of ease I sing;\\
Sagas of men of earth,\\
\idt Humanly suffering,\\
Such as you all have done;\\
\idt Savagely faring forth,\\
Sons of the midnight sun,\\
\idt Argonauts of the North.
}

\textit{
Far in the land God forgot\\
\idt Glimmers the lure of your trail;\\
Still in your lust are you taught\\
\idt Even to win is to fail.\\
Still must you follow and fight\\
\idt Under the vampire wing;\\
There in the long, long night\\
\idt Hoping and vanquishing.
}

\indentedblock\itshape{
Husbandmen of the Wild,\\
\idt Reaping a barren gain;\\
Scourged by desire, reconciled\\
\idt Unto disaster and pain;\\
These my songs are for you,\\
\idt You who are seared with the brand:\\
God knows I have tried to be true;\\
\idt Please God you will understand.
}
