I first discovered the poetry of Robert W. Service one night as a child, when my mother read to me from a weathered collection of his verse. I still remember her voice as she launched into “\textit{The Cremation of Sam McGee}” — the firelight flickering in the room, the strange comfort of that icy tale, and the rhythm that made it feel like both a story and a song.\\

Later that same night, she read me “\textit{Grin},” and something in its message stayed with me — a rough, resilient courage wrapped in rhyme. Though time passed and the words faded, I recently stumbled across the poem again, and the memory of that moment returned with clarity.\\

This book is, in part, a tribute to that night and to the enduring voice of the man known as the Bard of the Yukon. His poems have a way of cutting through the years — bold, humorous, unflinching — and reminding us that even in the face of hardship, we can press on... and perhaps even grin.
