I was just a teenager when Robert Service first came into my life. My mom was sitting in her chair one quiet evening, the lamplight falling across a worn book in her hands. I asked what she was reading, and she told me it was a poet—Robert Service. Before I knew it, she was reading The Cremation of Sam McGee aloud, her voice carrying that rhythm like a campfire tale in the Yukon night.\\

Not long after, I found Grin, and it stuck with me in a different way. There was grit in it, and humor too—a reminder to face the hard days with a crooked smile and a stubborn heart.\\

Years rolled on. Life took its turns. And then, while setting the type for this very book, I came across Grin again. This time, it wasn’t just familiar—it felt lived in. The words seemed to fit the lines of my own story better than ever before.\\

So this collection is more than just a gathering of poems. It’s a thread that runs from my mom’s chair on that quiet evening, through the years in between, and into my hands today. In setting these pages, I honor her as much as I honor the poet she introduced me to. And I hope, as you read, you feel a little of the same warmth, wonder, and resilience that she gave me when she first turned those pages.
