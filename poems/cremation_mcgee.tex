\poemchapter{The Cremation of Sam McGee}

\begin{verse}
\textit{
There are strange things done in the midnight sun\\
\hspace*{2em}By the men who moil for gold;\\
The Arctic trails have their secret tales\\
\hspace*{2em}That would make your blood run cold;\\
The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,\\
\hspace*{2em}But the queerest they ever did see\\
Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge\\
\hspace*{2em}I cremated Sam McGee.
}

Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee,\\
\hspace*{2em}Where the cotton blooms and blows.\\
Why he left his home in the South to roam\\
\hspace*{2em}‘Round the Pole, God only knows.\\
He was always cold, but the land of gold\\
\hspace*{2em}Seemed to hold him like a spell;\\
Though he’d often say in his homely way\\
\hspace*{2em}That “he’d sooner live in hell.”

On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way\\
\hspace*{2em}Over the Dawson trail.\\
Talk of your cold!—through the parka’s fold\\
\hspace*{2em}It stabbed like a driven nail.\\
If our eyes we’d close, then the lashes froze\\
\hspace*{2em}Till sometimes we couldn’t see;\\
It wasn’t much fun, but the only one\\
\hspace*{2em}To whimper was Sam McGee.

And that very night, as we lay packed tight\\
\hspace*{2em}In our robes beneath the snow,\\
And the dogs were fed, and the stars o’erhead\\
\hspace*{2em}Were dancing heel and toe,\\
He turned to me, and “Cap,” says he,\\
\hspace*{2em}“I’ll cash in this trip, I guess;\\
And if I do, I’m asking that you\\
\hspace*{2em}Won’t refuse my last request.”

Well, he seemed so low that I couldn’t say no;\\
\hspace*{2em}Then he says with a sort of moan:\\
“It’s the cursed cold, and it’s got right hold\\
\hspace*{2em}Till I’m chilled clean through to the bone.\\
Yet ‘tain’t being dead—it’s my awful dread\\
\hspace*{2em}Of the icy grave that pains;\\
So I want you to swear that, foul or fair,\\
\hspace*{2em}You’ll cremate my last remains.”

A pal’s last need is a thing to heed,\\
\hspace*{2em}So I swore I would not fail;\\
And we started on at the streak of dawn,\\
\hspace*{2em}But God! he looked ghastly pale.\\
He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day\\
\hspace*{2em}Of his home in Tennessee;\\
And before nightfall a corpse was all\\
\hspace*{2em}That was left of Sam McGee.

There wasn’t a breath in that land of death,\\
\hspace*{2em}And I hurried, horror-driven,\\
With a corpse half hid that I couldn’t get rid,\\
\hspace*{2em}Because of a promise given;\\
It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say:\\
\hspace*{2em}“You may tax your brawn and brains,\\
But you promised true, and it’s up to you\\
\hspace*{2em}To cremate those last remains.”

Now a promise made is a debt unpaid,\\
\hspace*{2em}And the trail has its own stern code.\\
In the days to come, though my lips were dumb,\\
\hspace*{2em}In my heart how I cursed that load.\\
In the long, long night, by the lone firelight,\\
\hspace*{2em}While the huskies, round in a ring,\\
Howled out their woes to the homeless snows—\\
\hspace*{2em}O God! how I loathed the thing.

And every day that quiet clay\\
\hspace*{2em}Seemed to heavy and heavier grow;\\
And on I went, though the dogs were spent\\
\hspace*{2em}And the grub was getting low;\\
The trail was bad, and I felt half mad,\\
\hspace*{2em}But I swore I would not give in;\\
And I’d often sing to the hateful thing,\\
\hspace*{2em}And it hearkened with a grin.

Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge,\\
\hspace*{2em}And a derelict there lay;\\
It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice\\
\hspace*{2em}It was called the “Alice May.”\\
And I looked at it, and I thought a bit,\\
\hspace*{2em}And I looked at my frozen chum;\\
Then “Here,” said I, with a sudden cry,\\
\hspace*{2em}“Is my crematorium.”

Some planks I tore from the cabin floor,\\
\hspace*{2em}And I lit the boiler fire;\\
Some coal I found that was lying around,\\
\hspace*{3em}And I heaped the fuel higher;\\
The flames just soared, and the furnace roared—\\
\hspace*{2em}Such a blaze you seldom see;\\
And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal,\\
\hspace*{2em}And I stuffed in Sam McGee.

Then I made a hike, for I didn’t like\\
\hspace*{2em}To hear him sizzle so;\\
And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled,\\
\hspace*{2em}And the wind began to blow.\\
It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled\\
\hspace*{2em}Down my cheeks, and I don’t know why;\\
And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak\\
\hspace*{2em}Went streaking down the sky.

I do not know how long in the snow\\
\hspace*{2em}I wrestled with grisly fear;\\
But the stars came out and they danced about\\
\hspace*{2em}Ere again I ventured near;\\
I was sick with dread, but I bravely said:\\
\hspace*{2em}“I’ll just take a peep inside.\\
I guess he’s cooked, and it’s time I looked.”\\
\hspace*{2em}... Then the door I opened wide.

And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm,\\
\hspace*{2em}In the heart of the furnace roar;\\
And he wore a smile you could see a mile,\\
\hspace*{2em}And he said: “Please close that door.\\
It’s fine in here, but I greatly fear\\
\hspace*{2em}You’ll let in the cold and storm—\\
Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee,\\
\hspace*{2em}It’s the first time I’ve been warm.”

\hspace*{2em}But the queerest they ever did see\\
